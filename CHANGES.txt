## Release 1.4: 2022-2-14

MR3
  - Use Deployment instead of ReplicationController on Kubernetes.
  - HistoryLogger correctly sends Vertex finish times to Timeline Server.
  - Add more Prometheus metrics.
  - Introduce `mr3.application.tags` and `mr3.application.scheduling.properties.map`.
  - The logic for speculative execution uses the average execution time of Tasks (instead of the maximum execution time).

Hive on MR3
  - DistCp jobs are sent to MR3, not to Hadoop. As a result, DistCp runs okay on Kubernetes.
  - org.apache.tez.common.counters.Limits is initialized in HiveServer2.
  - Update Log4j2 to 2.17.1 (for CVE-2021-44228).

## Release 1.3: 2021-8-18

MR3
  - Separate `mr3.k8s.keytab.secret` and `mr3.k8s.worker.secret`.
  - Introduce `mr3.container.max.num.workers` to limit the number of ContainerWorkers.
  - Introduce `mr3.k8s.pod.worker.node.affinity.specs` to specify node affinity for ContainerWorker Pods.
  - No longer use `mr3.convert.container.address.host.name`.
  - Support ContainerWorker recycling (which is different from ContainerWorker reuse) with `mr3.container.scheduler.scheme`.
  - Introduce `mr3.am.task.no.retry.errors` to specify the names of errors that prevent the re-execution of Tasks (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError,MapJoinMemoryExhaustionError`).
  - For reporting to MR3-UI, MR3 uses System.currentTimeMillis() instead of MonotonicClock.
  - DAGAppMaster correctly reports to MR3Client the time from DAG submission to DAG execution.
  - Introduce `mr3.container.localize.python.working.dir.unsafe` to localize Python scripts in working directories of ContainerWorkers. Localizing Python scripts is an unsafe operation: 1) Python scripts are shared by all DAGs; 2) once localized, Python scripts are not deleted.
  - The image pull policy specified in `mr3.k8s.pod.image.pull.policy` applies to init containers as well as ContainerWorker containers.
  - Introduce `mr3.auto.scale.out.num.initial.containers` which specifies the number of new ContainerWorkers to create in a scale-out operation when no ContainerWorkers are running. 
  - Introduce `mr3.container.runtime.auto.start.input` to automatically start LogicalInputs in RuntimeTasks.
  - Speculative execution works on Vertexes with a single Task.

Hive on MR3 
  - Metastore correctly uses MR3 for compaction on Kubernetes.
  - Auto parallelism is correctly enabled or disabled according to the result of compiling queries by overriding `tez.shuffle-vertex-manager.enable.auto-parallel`, so `tez.shuffle-vertex-manager.enable.auto-parallel` can be set to false.
  - Support the TRANSFORM clause with Python scripts (with `mr3.container.localize.python.working.dir.unsafe` to true in `mr3-site.xml`).
  - Introduce `hive.mr3.llap.orc.memory.per.thread.mb` to specify the memory allocated to each ORC manager in low-level LLAP I/O threads.

Spark on MR3
  - Initial release

## Release 1.2: 2020-10-26

MR3 
  - Introduce `mr3.k8s.pod.worker.init.container.command` to execute a shell command in a privileged init container.
  - Introduce `mr3.k8s.pod.master.toleration.specs` and `mr3.k8s.pod.worker.toleration.specs` to specify tolerations for DAGAppMaster and ContainerWorker Pods.
  - Setting `mr3.dag.queue.scheme` to `individual` properly implements fair scheduling among concurrent DAGs.
  - Introduce `mr3.k8s.pod.worker.additional.hostpaths` to mount additional hostPath volumes.
  - `mr3.k8s.worker.total.max.memory.gb` and `mr3.k8s.worker.total.max.cpu.cores` work okay when autoscaling is enabled.
  - DAGAppMaster and ContainerWorkers can publish Prometheus metrics.
  - The default value of mr3.container.task.failure.num.sleeps is 0.
  - Reduce the log size of DAGAppMaster and ContainerWorker.
  - TaskScheduler can process about twice as many events (`TaskSchedulerEventTaskAttemptFinished`) per unit time as in MR3 1.1, thus doubling the maximum cluster size that MR3 can manage.
  - Optimize the use of CodecPool shared by concurrent TaskAttempts.
  - The `getDags` command of MasterControl prints both IDs and names of DAGs.
  - On Kubernetes, the `updateResourceLimit` command of MasterControl updates the limit on the total resources for all ContainerWorker Pods. The user can further improve resource utilization when autoscaling is enabled.

Hive on MR3 
  - Compute the memory size of ContainerWorker correctly when `hive.llap.io.allocator.mmap` is set to true.
  - Hive expands all system properties in configuration files (such as core-site.xml) before passing to MR3.
  - `hive.server2.transport.mode` can be set to `all` (with HIVE-5312).
  - MR3 creates three ServiceAccounts: 1) for Metastore and HiveSever2 Pods; 2) for DAGAppMaster Pod; 3) for ContainerWorker Pods. The user can use IAM roles for ServiceAccounts.
  - Docker containers start as `root`. In `kubernetes/env.sh`, `DOCKER_USER` should be set to `root` and the service principal name in `HIVE_SERVER2_KERBEROS_PRINCIPAL` should be `root`.
  - Support Ranger 2.0.0 and 2.1.0.

## Release 1.1: 2020-7-19

MR3 
  - Support DAG scheduling schemes (specified by `mr3.dag.queue.scheme`).
  - Optimize DAGAppMaster by freeing memory for messages to Tasks when fault tolerance is disabled (with `mr3.am.task.max.failed.attempts` set to 1).
  - Fix a minor memory leak in DaemonTask (which also prevents MR3 from running more than 2^30 DAGs when using the shuffle handler).
  - Improve the chance of assigning TaskAttempts to ContainerWorkers that match location hints.
  - TaskScheduler can use location hints produced by `ONE_TO_ONE` edges.
  - TaskScheduler can use location hints from HDFS when assigning TaskAttempts to ContainerWorker Pods on Kubernetes (with `mr3.convert.container.address.host.name`).
  - Introduce `mr3.k8s.pod.cpu.cores.max.multiplier` to specify the multiplier for the limit of CPU cores.
  - Introduce `mr3.k8s.pod.memory.max.multiplier` to specify the multiplier for the limit of memory.
  - Introduce `mr3.k8s.pod.worker.security.context.sysctls` to configure kernel parameters of ContainerWorker Pods using init containers.
  - Support speculative execution of TaskAttempts (with `mr3.am.task.concurrent.run.threshold.percent`).
  - A ContainerWorker can run multiple shuffle handlers each with a different port. The configuration key `mr3.use.daemon.shufflehandler` now specifies the number of shuffle handlers in each ContainerWorker.
  - With speculative execution and the use of multiple shuffle handlers in a single ContainerWorker, fetch delays rarely occur.
  - A ContainerWorker Pod can run shuffle handlers in a separate container (with `mr3.k8s.shuffle.process.ports`).
  - On Kubernetes, DAGAppMaster uses ReplicationController instead of Pod, thus making recovery much faster.
  - On Kubernetes, ConfigMaps `mr3conf-configmap-master` and `mr3conf-configmap-worker` survive MR3, so the user should delete them manually.
  - Java 8u251/8u252 can be used on Kubernetes 1.17 and later.

Hive on MR3
  - CrossProductHandler asks MR3 DAGAppMaster to set `TEZ_CARTESIAN_PRODUCT_MAX_PARALLELISM` (Cf. HIVE-16690, Hive 3/4).
  - Hive 4 on MR3 is stable (currently using 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT).
  - No longer support Hive 1.
  - Ranger uses a local directory (emptyDir volume) for logging.
  - The open file limit for Solr (in Ranger) is not limited to 1024.
  - HiveServer2 and DAGAppMaster create readiness and liveness probes.

## Release 1.0: 2020-2-17

MR3 
  - Support DAG priority schemes (specified by `mr3.dag.priority.scheme`)
    and Vertex priority schemes (specified by `mr3.vertex.priority.scheme`).
  - Support secure shuffle (using SSL mode) without requiring separate configuration files.
  - ContainerWorker tries to avoid OutOfMemoryErrors by sleeping after a TaskAttempt fails (specified by `mr3.container.task.failure.num.sleeps`).
  - Errors from InputInitializers are properly passed to MR3Client.
  - MasterControl supports two new commands for gracefully stopping DAGAppMaster and ContainerWorkers.

Hive on MR3
  - Allow fractions for CPU cores (with `hive.mr3.resource.vcores.divisor`).
  - Support rolling updates.
  - Hive on MR3 can access S3 using AWS credentials (with or without Helm).
  - On Amazon EKS, the user can use S3 instead of PersistentVolumes on EFS.
  - Hive on MR3 can use environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to access S3 outside Amazon AWS.
